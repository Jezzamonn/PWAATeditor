# PWAATeditor
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy Save Editor

## Features

Currently the save editor only supports unlocking chapters in the game. More is planned to come.

## Compatibility

This has been tested on the PC and Nintendo Switch versions of the game.

Since the addresses were the same for both devices, I imagine this tool will work on other consoles, but I haven't tested.

Always make a backup and use at your own risk!

## Known Issues

After loading a save, you will have to restart the program to load a new one or view any changes.
