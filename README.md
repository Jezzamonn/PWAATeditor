# PWAATeditor
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy Save Editor

## Features

- Unlocking Chapters
- Changing in-game settings

## Compatibility

This has been tested on the PC and Nintendo Switch versions of the game.

Since the addresses were the same for both devices, I imagine this tool will work on other consoles, but I haven't tested.

Always make a backup and use at your own risk!
